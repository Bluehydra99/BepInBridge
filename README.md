# BepInBridge
If you are a MacOS or Linux Enter the Gungeon player, you do not have acess to modding. There are currently no loaders or tools that support BepInEx on this platform. This is the bridge. Currently, you will only download a README.md as I need coders to pick-up the project. More info is on the README. Check repository for any updates if interested.
